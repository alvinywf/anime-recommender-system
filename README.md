# Building a Recommender System for Anime Series

## Introduction
**Recommender systems** are widely used in e-commerce and entertainment platforms such as Amazon and Netflix, and their main purpose is to introduce to users different products or media that will most probably be of interest to them. Think along the lines of:

> Customers who bought this item also bought:
>
> Because you watched Brooklyn Nine-Nine, you will enjoy:

As users are introduced to new items that entice them, they will be more likely to make an additional purchase, thus driving up sales for the e-commerce platforms. Likewise, they will spend more time on entertainment platforms such as Spotify or YouTube and potentially increase the ad revenue for these companies.

In this notebook, we will attempt to build a recommender system that will introduce to me exciting new animes based on my historical preference. We will use both memory-based and model-based collaborative filtering methods.
